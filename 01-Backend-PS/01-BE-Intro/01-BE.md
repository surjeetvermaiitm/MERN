### Website vs Webapp

- Website: static read only contents (wikipedia,Blogging,news website)
- Webapp: dynamic content , read and write (instagram,twitter,tinder...)

Webapp: 3 tier Architecture

1.  Frontend
2.  backend
3.  DB

Framework - Minimum quality, to avoid the redundency, collaborate easily

- Steps to build Backend
- Backend is build in 3 different layers

1. Routes
2. Controller
3. Model

Logical way to build the BE (Router is dependent on controller, controller is dependent on model)
Step 1: Model : Database schema
Step 2: Controller
Step 3: ROuter
